# K-MEANS-CLUSTER-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-
Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. 

I had usedclustering to identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. 


In the dataset customers divides into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively. 

I had used K-means clustering and also visualize the gender and age distributions. 
Then analyze their annual incomes and spending scores.
